                   Class-6
* I understand page structure .But 

### 1.How does  the browser know  what the structure is and how to display it?
### 2.How does it know what images to display?
### 3.How html classifies page content ?

* It tells the browser which part is text and which part is an image and so on.
But we haven't seen how  the structure is turned into the actual page ,with certain paragraphs having a large font size and images positioned in some way on the page.
