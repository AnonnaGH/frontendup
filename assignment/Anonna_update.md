* I understand page structure .But 

### 1.How does  the browser know  what the structure is and how to display it?
### 2.How does it know what images to display?
### 3.How html classifies page content ?

* It tells the browser which part is text and which part is an image and so on.
But we haven't seen how  the structure is turned into the actual page ,with certain paragraphs having a large font size and images positioned in some way on the page.

## HTML (Hyper text Markup Language)
Language  —-- syntax + text
The basics of the language of a tag .
The browser turns HTML tags into elements that are from tree.

## Dom(Document Object model)

* The browser turn html tags into element that from a tree .
* It know how to do that because  of the DOM is a standard convertation for representating and interasting which element in html.
* So the tree we saw in developer tool was relly the DOM tree that browser built from an html document.

* Each html tag create an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.
